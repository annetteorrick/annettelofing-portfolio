<h2>
Inital User Research 
</h2>

<p>
I interviewed six participants about their habits when visiting coffee shops, and when mobile ordering from an app. Participants that enjoyed using mobile apps for ordering enjoyed having the ability to select their item, potentially customize it, and earn rewards. From this initial study on coffee shop related habits, I concluded… 
</p>

<h3> 
<b> The Main User Needs </b>
</h3>

<ul>
<li> <b> Order </b> coffee for pickup </li>
<li> <b> Browse </b> online menu </li>
<li> <b> Earn rewards </b> for purchases </li>
<li> <b> Customize </b> drink orders </li>
</ul>

<h2>
User Persona 
</h2>

<p>
Understanding the customer is crucial in an app design process. I created this persona from gathering research through user interviews with a user group who visit local coffee shops frequently. I incorporated those user research insights into this user persona.

<h2>
User Journey Map 
</h2>

<p> 
After creating a user persona, I also created a user journey map to help me understand the tasks that Iris needed to complete within the app.

<h2>
User Storyboards 
</h2>

<p>
I also found Storyboards helpful for mapping and understanding the user journey as the use the Kindred Coffee shop app.

<h2>
Competitive Audit 
</h2>

<p>
There are many different coffee shop apps already on the market. To understand what other apps are doing well and not so well, I conducted a competitive audit. I conducted research with direct competitors including Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Dunkin’ Donuts, and Black Rifle Coffee Co., as well as indirect competitors including Chick-Fil-A and Sonic. 
</p>
<p>
Overall this research was done to determine best practices and potential pitfalls to avoid from my competitors. 
</p>

<h4> 
Best Practices
</h4>
<ul>
<li> Ability to order and customize order within app </li>
<li> Scan app or purchase within app to receive rewards </li>
<li> Visually appealing, good use of white space </li>
<li> Clear brand identity </li>
</ul>

<h4> 
Pitfalls 
</h4>
<ul>
<li> Small pictures and text </li>
<li> Use of colors not accessible for all users </li>
<li> Hierarchy confusing, no search available for menu options </li>
<li> Verbiage that only targeted one user group </li>
</ul>
